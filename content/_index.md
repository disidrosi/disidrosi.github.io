# Hi there! :wave:

Glad you found my small corner of the internet. I am Tobia Cavalli, I am a
materials scientist with a passion for designing and developing functional
materials.

I have an academic background in computational chemistry and materials synthesis
and characterization, which I now use to bridge fundamental research and
industrial applications. I currently live in Niedersachsen, Germany, where I
work for Barberini (EssilorLuxottica) as an R&D engineer, developing new glasses
for sun lenses.

In my spare time, I love reading and writing about science, technology, and
philosophy. [Here](/reading/) you can find a list of my current and past
reading. I use my [blog](/blog/) as a learning space to improve my understanding
about chemistry, materials science, and anything else I might find interesting.
