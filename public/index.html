<h1 id="hi-there-wave">Hi there! &#x1f44b;</h1>
<p>Glad you found my small corner of the internet. I am Tobia Cavalli, I am a
materials scientist with a passion for designing and developing functional
materials.</p>
<p>I have an academic background in computational chemistry and materials synthesis
and characterization, which I now use to bridge fundamental research and
industrial applications. I currently live in Niedersachsen, Germany, where I
work for Barberini (EssilorLuxottica) as an R&amp;D engineer, developing new glasses
for sun lenses.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I love reading and writing about science, technology, and
philosophy. <a href="/reading/">Here</a> you can find a list of my current and past
reading. I use my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> as a learning space to improve my understanding
about chemistry, materials science, and anything else I might find interesting.</p>
